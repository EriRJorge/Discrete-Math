# Discrete Math Quiz
A dynamic web-based quiz application designed to help students practice discrete mathematics concepts. This project was developed to provide an interactive learning experience with instant feedback and topic-specific resources.

## Features
- **Randomized Questions** from multiple discrete math topics
- **Interactive Solutions** available on-demand
- **Topic PDFs** for detailed concept review
- **Study Streak Counter** to track progress
- **Clean Interface** focused on learning experience

## Important Notice
The PDF materials included in this project are the intellectual property of Dr. Rick Halterman at Southern Adventist University. This is a study tool specifically designed for the Discrete Mathematics class at Southern Adventist University, and all credit for the educational content and materials goes to Dr. Rick Halterman. These materials should not be distributed or used outside of their intended educational purpose.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have a PHP environment set up (Apache, Nginx, or PHP CLI)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/discrete-math-quiz.git
   ```
3. Move into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd discrete-math-quiz
   ```
4. Start a local PHP server:
   ```sh
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
5. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

### Requirements
- PHP 7.0 or higher
- Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- PDF viewer for topic materials

## Usage
The quiz system provides practice questions across three main areas:
- **Set Theory** - operations, notations, and basic concepts
- **Combinatorics** - permutations, combinations, counting principles
- **Mathematical Logic** - truth tables, logical operations, proofs

### How to Use
- **Start Quiz** through the welcome screen
- **View Solutions** by clicking solution toggles
- **Access Resources** via PDF links
- **Track Progress** with the study streak counter
- **Generate New Questions** using the refresh button

## Roadmap
Planned features and enhancements:
- **Additional Topics** in discrete mathematics
- **Progress Tracking** across sessions
- **Custom Quiz Generation** by topic selection
